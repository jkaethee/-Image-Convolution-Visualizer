## Image-Convolution-Visualizer
A small web application to visualize different convolutions by using image kernels, built with Python, Flask, HTML, and Bulma.

This application is a joint project between [Avery Ryoo](https://github.com/averyryoo) and [Jathushan Kaetheeswaran](https://github.com/jkaethee). It was inspired by [Victor Powell's excellent post](https://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels) as well as theory we learned during our SYDE 575 - Image Processing course at the University of Waterloo.

The project is intended to practice development with Python libraries such as NumPy, OpenCV, Scikit-image, and Python Imaging Library.
It also reinforces our web development skills with Python by allowing us to utilize Flask's framework for rapid development.
